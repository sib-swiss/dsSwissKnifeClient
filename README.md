dsBaseClient
============

Functions and utilities that extend the functionality of the opal/datashield suite of packages. Client side.



About
=====

dsSwissKnifeClient is a software package which builds upon (and extends) DataSHIELD (https://www.datashield.ac.uk) to allow non-disclosive remote federated analysis on sensitive data. Like most DataSHIELD packages it has a client-server infrastructure so it needs to be used together with the server version, dsSwissKnife (https://github.com/datashield/dsSwissKnife).

Functionality include implementations for a kmeans clustering algorithm, PCA, as well as a number of functions from specific packages (imputation with VIM, random forests with randomForest, synthetic data generation with Synthpop, etc). 
Please consult the documentation for the individual functions for more details.
