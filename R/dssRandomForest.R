#' @title Distributed random forests based on the randomForest package.
#' @description Builds a random forest on each server node,
#'   as a model to predict classification of new data of the same type
#'   (new patients, same variables). The randomForest package needs to be
#'   installed on all nodes and on the client.
#' @return a randomForest object.
#' @param what: name of the training data frame on the server.
#' @param dep_var: [string] the response factor ("y"), i.e. the categories
#'   that will be the leaves of each tree.
#' @param expl_vars: [vector[string]] the classification variables.
#' @param testData: [data frame] new data to classify using the forests.
#'   It must have at least the columns in `expl_vars`.
#'   (We want to predict the value of `dep_var` for it.)
#' @return a list with members `$forests`: the individual forests from the nodes,
#'   and `$prediction`, the average prediction of `testData` (if given) by all nodes together.
